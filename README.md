# Evalita HaSpeeDe 2018
This project goal is to implement, test and compare several different deep learning models w.r.t. the HaSpeeDe (i.e., hate-speech detection) task from the Evalita 2018 challenge.

The dataset used for development and testing was obtained from [Evalita 2018](https://www.di.unito.it/~tutreeb/haspeede-evalita18/). An overview of the task, as well as the results' of previous participants can be found at [HaSpeeDe-1 overview](https://books.openedition.org/aaccademia/4503?lang=it) [1]

More information about the considered models, as well as the methodology we employed in our analyses and our results can be found in the [report]()
